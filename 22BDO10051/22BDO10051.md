## Aim :  
1. You again live in your own branch, this time we will be doing a bit of juggling with branches, to show how lightweight branches are in git.
1.	Create a branch called greeting and switch to it
2.	Edit the greeting.txt to contain your favorite greeting
3.	Add greeting.txt files to the staging area
4.	Commit
5.	Switch back to the master branch
6.	Create a file README.md with information about this repository
7.	Add the README.md file to staging area and make the commit
8.	What is the output of git log --oneline --graph --all?
9.	Diff the branches
10.	Merge the greeting branch into master
11.	What is the output of git log --oneline --graph --all now? Observe the extra merge commit created with the message "Merge branch 'greeting'".

## Steps and Outputs :  
1. Fork the repository to your github account using fork option.
2. Now using git clone and link of forked repository create a local copy of the repository.
